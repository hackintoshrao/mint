# Mint
Collection of tests to detect resource leaks, gauge performance problems and overall quality of Minio server.

## Goals
- To run tests in self contained manner, with various tools pre-installed.
- To asses the quality of the Minio server product.

## How to Run
The project will be published in Docker hub after further more testing. Till then the docker image has to be built locally and run.

### Build

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/minio/mint.git
$ cd mint
$ docker build -t minio/mint:alpha .
```

### Options

Options are provided as environment variables to the docker container. Supported envs:

 - `S3_ADDRESS`     - <IP/URL>:<PORT> of the Minio server on which the tests has to be run.
 - `ACCESS_KEY`   - Access Key of the server.
 - `SECRET_KEY`   - Secret Key of the server.
 - `ENABLE_HTTPS` - Optional value when set to 1 sends HTTPS requests on SSL enabled deployment.


### Run

```sh
$ docker run -e S3_ADDRESS=play.minio.io:9000 -e ACCESS_KEY=Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F  -e SECRET_KEY=zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG -e ENABLE_HTTPS=1  minio/mint:alpha
```

Note: With no env variables provided the tests are run on play.minio.io by default

### Current tests
- SDK Tests (Contains tests using S3 compatible client libraries)
  - Minio-go functional tests.

- Functional tests (Tests with handcrafted HTTP requests for various functionalities)
  - Minio server functional test.
 
### Adding tests. 
- See if the new tests fit into the existing category of tests (ex: sdk-tests).
- If yes follow the instructions in the README.md inside the test category folder.
- If not, create a folder for the new test category and add your tests there.
- Add build.sh and run.sh to build and run the test, and README.md with info in the test category folder (see sdk-tests).
- Set permissions and execute build.sh and run.sh of the new tests from `run.sh` in the project root.
